This might be helpful to sort dates

class Article {
  constructor(title, date) {
    this.title = title;
    this.date = date;
  }

  static compare(articleA, articleB) {
    return articleA.date - articleB.date;
  }
}

// usage
let articles = [
  new Article("HTML", new Date(2019, 1, 1)),
  new Article("CSS", new Date(2019, 0, 1)),
  new Article("JavaScript", new Date(2019, 11, 1))
];

articles.sort(Article.compare);

alert( articles[0].title ); // CSS

I need an array to store the projects and to store the tasks. Maybe an array of objects, where each object is a project that includes an array of tasks

I need a function which retrieves a project and associated tasks and then renders them onto the project display area. I can either do this with a table
that displays each task, or as divs like cards that display a task's properties including:
  
  Checkmark for complete
  Title
  Description
  Project
  Due Date
  Priority
  'x' to delete the task from the list

So a project will have a name and associated tasks while a task will have title, description, due date, priority, project and notes.

Functionality:
Inbox button - displays all tasks that do not have a project associated with them
Today - sorts then displays all tasks that are due today with their associated projects
This Week - sorts then displays all the tasks that are due this week with their associated projects

So when one of these functions is pressed the results are displayed in the display area and display:
  Task with title, description, due date, priority and notes AND project also a delete button to delete the task
  
Methods:
  Sort method for Today
  Sort method for This week
  Maybe todayTasks pick all tasks for today
        weekTasks pick all tasks for the week
  Method to apply a new task to a project
  Method to create a new project and add it to the project array
  Method to create a new task and add it to the task array

List of modules in use:
  setDisplayTitle() - Takes user's click and displays appropriate title, In Box, Today, This Week
  createBlankTask - Creates a blank task in the project display area
